# Data Processing Scripts for OWASP Top 10 LLM Analysis

This repository contains a series of Python scripts designed for processing and categorizing data relevant to the study of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). The scripts facilitate tasks such as combining CSV files, categorizing data based on various criteria, and applying these categorizations to a dataset.

## Script 1: Combining CSV Files

This script combines multiple CSV files into a single DataFrame. Ensure the correct paths are specified for your CSV files.

```python
import pandas as pd

# List of your CSV files with the correct path
csv_files = [
    r'C:PATH1.csv',
    r'C:PATH2.csv',
    r'C:PATH3.csv',
    r'C:PATH4.csv'
]

try:
    # Combine all CSV files into one DataFrame
    combined_df = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(file) for file in csv_files], ignore_index=True)
    print("CSV files successfully combined.")
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)
```

## Script 2: Categorization Functions

These functions categorize text data based on predefined criteria such as research methods, focus areas, topics/themes, geographical and temporal focus.

```python
def categorize_research_methods(text):
    # ... [Insert the full function code here]

def categorize_focus_areas(text):
    # ... [Insert the full function code here]

def categorize_topics_themes(text):
    # ... [Insert the full function code here]

def categorize_geographical_focus(text):
    # ... [Insert the full function code here]

def categorize_temporal_focus(text):
    # ... [Insert the full function code here]
```

## Script 3: Applying Categorizations

This script applies the above categorization functions to the DataFrame created by combining CSV files.

```python
combined_df['Focus Areas'] = combined_df[' Description '].apply(categorize_focus_areas)
combined_df['Topics or Themes'] = combined_df[' Description '].apply(categorize_topics_themes)
combined_df['Geographical Focus'] = combined_df[' Description '].apply(categorize_geographical_focus)
combined_df['Temporal Focus'] = combined_df[' Description '].apply(categorize_temporal_focus)
```
